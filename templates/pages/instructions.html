          <li>The purpose of this experiment is to test an algorithm that I created, which analyzes users' typing styles and determines how much their typing style matches that of the account that they're attempting to log in to. This is done in order to provide an extra level of security by denying access to users whose typing style does not match that of the account they are trying to access.</li>
          <li>
            Before beginning the experiment you and your parent/guardian must read and sign the <a href="https://na4.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=d90bb626-0f33-462a-9ec9-e1eb7bec03a1&env=na4&acct=42f07939-6841-481e-b8ce-a26d10852ce7&v=2" target="_blank">Consent Form.</a> Please click the link, fill in your parent/guardian's info and sign the document. Afterwards, have your parent/guardian go into their email and find the form link that they were sent from DocuSign and have them sign that.
          </li>
          <li>In the first part of the experiment, you will be asked to enter the account information of 6 different people who have already completed this test.</li>
          <li>Secondly, you will be asked to create your own account by typing in a username and password of your choice 9 times.</li>
          <li>Lastly, you will be asked to type in your own account information 6 times.</li>
